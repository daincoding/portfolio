    text: `I have had the pleasure of working with Alex at Blankhans. During this time Alex continuously demonstrated a good understanding of development process and a wide array of audio responsibilities, which was remarkable as there was no prior experience in the development field.

Managing Alex was one of the more enjoyable parts of my responsibilities. Alex is self motivated, eager to learn and receptive to feedback. The quality of work was high and delivered in a consistent and timely manner. The title we worked on repeatedly got very positive feedback for the music and sound as a whole, something Alex had complete ownership of and deserves all credits for.

Alex was a great colleague, not just as a talented composer and sound designer, but equally because of his person. Kind, joyful and a real dedication to his work made working with Alex a delight. Needless to say, I would recommend Alex to any team in need of a composer and/or audio designer.`,

Alex always stepped in when there was something to pick-up in the company, no matter what it was.`,
